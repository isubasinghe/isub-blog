## On Death

Perhaps this should be called `On Life`, but I thought `On Death` was a more catchy, clickbaity name so I went with that. This is something personal to me, but I think may help 
other people who are going through the same feelings that I felt. 

### Nothing Matters
This is a bit of a nihilistic statement to say the least, but it is true. Absolutely nothing truly matters in life, at least from a scientific 
point of view, you can make emotional points against this, but I struggle to accept them as they are in my opinion, highly subjective. None of the advances humanity makes will be worth anything, your personal life, your friends, your family, absolutely none of them 
will make any impact on the universe. No scientist, no politician, no matter how powerful humanity gets, will be able to stop the inevtiable heat death of 
our universe. This can be confronting, it reminds me a bit of Sisyphus, humanity pushes its' own boulder enduring thousands of atrocities, wars, famines and exploitation and spending time, money and lives in the process of doing so, but all this sacrifice will eventually be meaningless. We are generally too distracted by the boulder to recognise the meaningless of it all, but taking a moment to think about it places individuals in a confr positions. When one is at this point in life, there are generally two paths to take, one being extremely toxic and unhealthy while the other can provide happiness and closure. 

#### Path \#1
The first path is what I took for a bit of time, I was extremely unhappy and had to change my point of view. After the initial confrontation with nothingness, one may decide that if nothing matters, why do anything at all? Perhaps life should be about selfish indulgence, consuming whatever makes you happy, tuning out and not caring about the negative actions and situations humans face on a daily basis. This path is extremely harmful to not only yourself but the people around you. 

#### Path \#2
The next path is to think of life as a movie. We each get a ticket to a movie that is only shown once, do we spend our time waiting for the movie to end, being miserable inside or do we enjoy the short while it goes for? The movie doesn't matter of course, it's just a movie at the end of the day. There are of course certain edge cases where this analogy fails, but I think it captures the general essence of my thoughts. My point really is that it is quite alright that our lives don't matter, in fact that knowledge can itself be empowering, there is no objective right or wrong, there is no objective morality, it is up to you to define what is right, wrong and morally correct. Culture, tradition and all those human made things are irrelevant, they are rituals a bunch of people like you got together and made up, so go ahead have icecream for lunch or alcohol in the morning, it doesn't really matter.
