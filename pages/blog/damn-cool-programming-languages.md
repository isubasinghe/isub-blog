## Some interesting, unique programming languages
Most of these are functional programming languages because a lot of the interesting features are only present in 
FP languages. 

### Futhark
What is Futhark?
The website calls itself a "statically typed, data-parallel, and purely functional array language in the ML family, and comes with a heavily optimising ahead-of-time compiler". 
I won't go into what "statically typed and purely functional" mean here, those aren't the interesting features of the language. 
The interesting feature is "data-parallel" and "array language". 
### Unison 
What is Unison?
Unison is amazing, it is one of the most "out there" languages in this list.

### Idris
What is Idris?
It is basically Haskell but better, it has first class types. 

### Dafny 
What is Dafny?

### Zig 
What is Zig?
Zig is a programming language that aims to be a modern C. 
### Elm
What is Elm?
Elm is a functional programming language that compilex to JavaScript. The coolest part about this language is the concept of FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

### Eiffel
What is Eiffel?
I first came across this in the book `The Pragmatic Programmer`.

### Hamler
What is Hamler?

### Mun 
What is Mun?
I found Mun when exploring for embedded languages in Rust, ideally one that was fast through JITing. 
Mun is not that, Mun actually is an embeddable programming language with a cool unique feature, it is AOT compiled. 
This makes it perfect for glue code in compute intensive programs such as game engines, databases, web servers and more. 

### Caramel 
What is Caramel?
Following from the trend of languages that compile to Erlang, Caramel is an OCaml like language that cmopiles to Erlang. 
It is the perfect language if Haskell if Haskell is too restrictive or slows you down. 

### Koka
